# graph
Find All path in a acyclic graph
## Logic
Finding all paths through all vertex between 2 nodes is a traversal path for the graph. If we do the same for the vertex them we get
all the paths.
<br />
for finding path between 2 nodes we are using `dfs`.

## Test
For test we need to install `nose` test module using
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To Run Test 

```
nosetests
```
This run tests in the test directory.
